        In the present scenario of globalization there is tremendous demand for
        skilled manpower particularly in the area of Engineering and Technology.
        Therefore, Training and Placement (T&P) was set up with a view to
        provide necessary impetus to launch our students into the real world
        where cut-throat competition is the order of the day.
